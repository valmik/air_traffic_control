Cosmetic problems:
Animate a circle for the airport, so that we can see when planes touch it
Small plane pictures that can move

BIG Problem:
If a plane isn't facing close enough such that in one prediction horizon it
can point toward the origin, it will end up veering off into space because
it doesn't understand that it needs to turn around / can't simulate it properly

Ideas:
- make the plane fly at a constant radius large enough that it can recover from it

Other Problem:
Lots of simulation failures start to crop up over time

Ideas:
- potentially something to do with initial conditions. One thing we might want to 
do is use the previous predicted inputs to generate a path at the new start state
and using the new timestep. Or possibly by interpolating over the previous optimized
trajectory from the second state on using the new timestep. This could then be the 
seed to the optimization
- There's potentially something wrong in the linearization of the plane model which
causes errors to crop up as heading angle changes
